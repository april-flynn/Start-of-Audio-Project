# Start-of-Audio-Project
This audio is my progress so far on completing my audio project. As previously mentioned in our last class session, this audio is meant to replicate the atmosphere of my childhood home and end with a fade into teenage years. So far, I have complied a few audio clips including creaking floor boards, children laughing, and people chatting (as my home was often full of people chatting about). I have edited some clips of people talking to have a slight distortion to them, aiding the listener to hear this world through the mind of a child, not fully grasping everything. I have also added some clips to be quieter and others to be louder to create a more dynamic pool of sound. However, I am struggling with figuring out how exactly to move the clips around. I have tried using timeshift tools and duplicating clips into different sections of the audio, but still can't quite get that down.
